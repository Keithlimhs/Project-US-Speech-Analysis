    "\n",
    "To do that, we will use Obama and Trump's State of the Union speeches between 2010 to 2020 for analysis. The State of the Union speeches are speeches that presidents give at the beginning of each calendar year to propose legislative agenda and national priorities.\n",

    "How so? This will be a bit old-school:\n",
    "1. Google for \"Obama/Trump State of the Union Speech XXXX\" where XXXX is a year\n",
    "2. Copy and paste the speech in a text editor, e.g., Notepad, Microsoft Word, etc\n",
    "3. Save the file in your directory as a .txt file\n",
    "\n",
    "Obama's speeches are from 2010 to 2016, and Trump's speeches are from 2018 to 2020. \n",
    "\n",
    "It won't be difficult finding the speeches, but in the case where you're unable to collect the data, download it from <a href = \"https://uplevelsg.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ProjectUSSpeech/AllSpeeches.zip\">here</a>.\n",
